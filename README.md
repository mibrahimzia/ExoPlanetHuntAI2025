> *“A World Away” — Using machine learning to classify exoplanet candidates from Kepler mission data.*

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project was developed for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025** under the theme “A World Away.” It leverages artificial intelligence to analyze planetary and stellar parameters and classify whether a celestial body is a **Confirmed Exoplanet**, a **Candidate**, or a **False Positive**.

Built with Python and Gradio, this web app provides an intuitive interface for both single predictions and bulk classification of exoplanet data. Whether you're a researcher, educator, or space enthusiast, you can explore how AI helps astronomers sift through cosmic noise to find new worlds.

   cd 2025_NASA_Space_Apps_Challenge_A_world_away_hunting_for_exoplanets_with_AI
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the app:
   ```bash

## 🖥️ Interface Features

The app has three main tabs:

### 1. Single Prediction
Enter values manually for:
- Orbital Period (days)
- Transit Duration (hrs)
- Planet Radius (Earth radii)
- Star Temperature (K)
- Star Radius (Solar radii)

Click **Submit** to get an instant prediction with confidence indicator.

### 2. Bulk CSV Prediction
Upload or select sample datasets (like `test_sample.csv`) to classify multiple entries at once. Results are displayed in a preview table and can be downloaded as a `.csv`.

> ✅ Green check = Confirmed Exoplanet  
> 🟡 Yellow dot = Candidate  
> ❌ Red X = False Positive

### 3. Insights
View model performance metrics and confidence graphs (see below).

## 📊 Model Confidence & Performance Graphs
<img width="633" height="470" alt="proba_dist" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c643e957-f174-484c-ba67-c6832cf72502" />
Most confirmed exoplanets are predicted with high confidence (right side), while non-exoplanets cluster on the low-confidence side (left). This shows the model makes clear, reliable decisions.

The high AUC score (0.93) means the model is very good at telling real exoplanets apart from false signals.


Our classifier outputs not just labels but also **confidence scores**, helping users understand how certain the model is about each prediction. The Insights tab displays visualizations such as:
- Class-wise precision/recall
- Confidence score histograms
- Feature importance rankings

These graphs help validate the model’s reliability and guide further refinement using domain knowledge.

## 💡 Tip: Don’t Have Formatted Data?

If you don’t have pre-formatted data, you can:
- Download sample files directly from this repo (e.g., `test_sample.csv`)
- Or use the dropdown menu in the app to choose from built-in examples

> 🔗 *“If you don't have formatted data, click [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mibrahimzia/2025_NASA_Space_Apps_ChallengeA_world_away_hunting_for_exoplanets_with_AI/tree/main) to download a few from Space’s repo or use the drop-down menu to choose from.”*

### ✅ Next Steps:
1. Make sure you have a `LICENSE` file in your repo root (GitHub can auto-generate one when you choose Apache 2.0).
2. Replace `yourusername` and the Hugging Face link with real values.
3. Add your actual `confidence_graph.png` to an `images/` folder (or update the image path).

Let me know if you'd like a dark-mode-friendly version or additional badges (e.g., for stars, forks, or CI status)! 🚀
